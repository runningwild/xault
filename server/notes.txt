Make Id:
C->S: Id, Pe, Pv     Client sends id and public keys
S->C: Pe(Challenge)  Server sends a challenge encrypted with Pe
C->S: Ps(Challenge)  Client decrypts the challenge and signs it with it's Ps

Add Contact:
A->B: Public Keys, Ra (nonce chosen by A), Sa(Ra)
	// B knows nothing at this point, A could be doing a replay attack
B->A: Public Keys, Rb, Envelope(H(Ra+Rb))
	// If A was doing a replay attack, then A knows nothing, B could be replaying the rest of that transaction.
	// If A was not attacking, then A knows that B has the private keys he claims to have, otherwise
	// he would not be able to seal an envelope with A's nonce, Ra.

C->S: Id, Envelope(SPe, Ps, ContactId)
